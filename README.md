This is my first ever repository for DS/ML solutions.                                                                                     
The programming language in which the solutions are written (by their authors and adopted by me) is R. 

Important note - I did not copy and paste their code, nor fork a kernel from Kaggle and debug it. The solution was done line by line, occasionally modifying what's suggested, and is not entirely the same.

Titanic survival prediction problem is a challenge for beginners at Kaggle.                                                               
The first solution is by Megan Risdal, it's using mice imputation method and random forest prediction model.                               
The second solution is by Trevor Stephens, it's also using random forest prediction and somewhat more creative feature engineering.       
Score of both these solutions is close to 81% prediction accuracy.

The challenge is to predict which passengers will die and which - survive upon knowing their certain characteristics (age, class, ticket price, gender).
